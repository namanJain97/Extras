ERROR: Cannot install mlflow because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    docker 4.2.2 depends on pypiwin32==223; sys_platform == "win32" and python_version >= "3.6"
    docker 4.1.0 depends on pypiwin32==223; sys_platform == "win32" and python_version >= "3.6"

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
