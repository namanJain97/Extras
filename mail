Hi Naman, 

Hope you are well- hoping you can help answer a question on remediation for me please.

Is there an amount threshold for when we need to engage finance ahead of completing any remediation?

Also does it make a difference if it is a true refund, compensation or interest adjustment?

Many thanks 
Emma
